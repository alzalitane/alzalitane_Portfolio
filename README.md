# [Project 1: Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic](https://github.com/alzalitane/Google-Cyclistic)

## Introduction:
A capstone project that was part of the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera. You will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**. 

## Scenario:
As a junior data analyst I am tasked to work with the marketing team at Cyclistic a bike sharing company in Chicago. The company seeks to maximize the number of annual memberships and seek to understandd how the casual rider and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Using these insights gained from the data analysis the team will be able to design a new marketing startegy to convert more casual riders to annual members. Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Characters and teams:
  ● Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.

  ● Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns
and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

  ● Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy
learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic
achieve them.

  ● Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
recommended marketing program.

## About the company:
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are
interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

# [Project 2: EMSAT Score Prediction](https://alzalitane.shinyapps.io/Emsat_Prediction/?_ga=2.147398705.780812755.1658315813-238353889.1658315813)


## Introduction:
The EmSAT is a national system of standardized computer-based tests, based on United Arab Emirates national standards.

## Objectives:
Create an application by which students can use their previous subject results to predict their resepctive EMSAT score before undertaking the exam thus giving the student an idea of his or her current level in the subject.

## Importance of EmSAT:

-  Assess the knowledge and skills of candidates in the transitional stages after the general education stage and the transition to the higher education stage.

-  Used for university admission purposes

-  Used for evaluating the effectiveness of schools’ performance and the quality of the educational system and taking the necessary decisions for improvements

-  Provide decision-makers information about the skills acquired by students in their different academic levels.

-  Assembling accurate data about the knowledge and skills of students in the United Arab Emirates in academic subjects and across different academic cycles in accordance with national standards.

-  Helping students determine the appropriate educational paths

-  Determining the level of students' performance nationally and internationally.

## Scenario:

UAE grade 12, secondary school students undertake standartized exams for university admission called the EMSATS. The main subjects the students undertake exams in are as follows:
-  English
-  Maths
-  Arabic
-  Physics

The score is out of 2000.

# [Project 3: OIP Monte Carlo Simulation](https://alzalitane.shinyapps.io/STOIP_MC/?_ga=2.118048911.780812755.1658315813-238353889.1658315813)


## Introduction:
It is practically impossible to be exactly sure how much crude oil there is available for production in oil reservoirs. As a result geologists and reservoir engineers have devised numerous methods and tools in order to calculate the potential production rate from said reservoir. 

## Objectives:
Create an application that will deploy a Monte Carlo simulation using reservoir properties to calculate the low(P90) mid(P50) and high(P10) production rate quickly.

# [Project 4: AG School Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ahmed.muftah/viz/AGSchool/AGSchoolAnalysis?publish=yes)


## Introduction:
AG School is a secondary school located in Westbrook-Margate. It deals with students from numerous nationalities and backgrounds. The school can cater for 900 students per year.

## Objectives:
Create an online dashboard that will be used to analyze students score performance for term 2 of the 2021-2022 academic year, look for relationship between students performance and abscence as well as to gain insight on how to imporove student performance for the next term. You are also been tasked with determining the number of students whom are below average, normal, and those whom have exceeded expectations as well as the students whom are top and bottom of their respective classes.

## Scenario:

You have been tasked with analyzing the students results for term 2 of the 2021-2022 academic year.

# [Project 5: US Labour Condition Applications Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ahmed.muftah/viz/USLabourConditionApplications/Story1?publish=yes)


## Introduction:
When a US company wants to hire someone from outside of the United States for a technical
position, they have to file an application to the United States government to get a green card or visa
for the foreign applicant. These applications allow the US government to track who is entering and
leaving the country for work-related reasons, and ensure that immigrants are neither being taken
advantage of nor causing adverse effects for U.S. workers. To ensure equity for US and non-US
workers, companies have to state how much they are planning on paying the employee every time
they submit a visa or green card application. They also have to state the average amount an
employee with similar skills and background typically gets paid for the same position, a figure
called “the prevailing wage.” This publically available data provides a unique view into what types
of salaries you might encounter for different data–related jobs in the US.

## Objectives:
Create an online dashboard that explores the raw data.

## Source:
The original data was compiled by the US Department of Labor’s Office of Foreign Labor
Certification (http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm).
